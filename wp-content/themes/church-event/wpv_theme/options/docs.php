<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Quick Import? How does it Help Me?</b></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>This is a great feature that helps novice WordPress users and
veterans alike. This feature makes the necessary
settings/configurations and installs demo content in the WordPress
theme: categories, pages, posts and widgets.</p>
<p>Your VamTam theme will look exactly like the one you see on our live
preview . It doesn't matter if you know WordPress inside out or seen it
for the first time, it's always easier to modify posts, categories,
pages and widgets that are already there rather than creating them from
scratch. Moreover it is easier to understand how your new VamTam theme
works.</p>
<p>Our Quick Import is a tremendous feature that will save you a lot of
frustration and headache at a press of a button. Try it out. We promise
you won’t be disappointed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You can access the feature from your WordPress admin panel:</p>
<p>WP navigation menu =&gt; VamTam =&gt; Quick Import</p>
<p>Please note that the dummy content doesn't come with the original
images due to copyright restrictions. You will need to add your images
manually.</p>
<p>You will notice that widgets, content and Layered Slider demo slides can be imported separately.
</p>
<p>Click on Save Changes.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Logo</b></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Using a Text Logo</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Settings =&gt; General in the WordPress left side navigation menu.</li>
<li>Locate the Site Title item.</li>
<li>Change it to what you like.</li>
<li>Click the "Save Changes" button.</li>
</ol>
<br><br><p>Using an Image as a Logo</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<ol>
<li>Please go to General Settings in the VamTam theme left side navigation menu.</li>
<li>Locate the "Custom Logo Picture" and upload your logo.</li>
<li>Click the "Save Changes" button.</li>
</ol>
<b><br></b><p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Menu</b></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>WordPress automatically creates a menu of your pages for you,
but the Custom Menu feature gives you complete control of what appears
in the menu, where it appears and also the menu title. Many times the
page title you want to use will take up big part of the width of your
header where the navigation menu appears. Custom menu allows you to
shorten or totally change the name that appears in the navigation.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>We use Custom Menus feature in all our themes. If you haven't imported the demo content, you have to create one.</p>

<p><br></p>
<ol>
<li>Global layout options located here: VamTam Theme Options =&gt; Layout.
</li>

<p>VamTam Theme Options =&gt; Layout=&gt;Footer</p>
<p>This builder is used in the body top and the footer widget areas but not the sidebars in the body.</p>
<p>Please note that you can easily re-create the footer and the body top
widget areas and the widgets, by importing the dummy widgets data from
theme options =&gt; quick import =&gt; import widgets. If you have done
so, you will learn in this section how to change the layout of the
widget areas and the widgets.</p>
<p>In the footer and the body top widget areas of your website you can
place from one up to six widget areas. In each widget area you can place
as many widgets as you need .</p>

<p><br><br></p>
<ol>

have a widget area that spans only one third of the width of the
website and still being the only widget area on this raw.</li>
<li>Press the button "Save Changes" when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<br><br><p>Once you have created the layout you can now add widgets to the widget areas you have created.</p>

<p>Please note that you have default - blog post, portfolio post,
general page widget areas. There is no point using custom widget areas
if you haven't used the default one yet.</p>

<p>Church and Event comes with many custom shortcodes that
allow you to add custom styles to your post/page/portfolio content. You
can get the shortcodes from the demo website or from the Admin Panel.
Above the text editor in the top right side you will notice three tabs -
Visual, Text, VamTam.</p>
<p>The VamTam drag &amp; drop editor is tightly integrated with tinymce
editor and you can switch to visual or text editor at any time without
losing any changes.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Shortcode Generator</b></p>
<p>You can easily insert Shortcodes by using the Shortcode Generator
that can be found on the toolbar of the visual editor. You can select
the shortcode in the dropdown menu and simply change the options in the
shortcode editor and then click Insert to insert the shortcode into the
content editor.</p>
<p>Please note that only the shortcodes for styling the text can be found here. In the "VamTam"tab</p>
<p>above the text editor you will find the drag and drop page builder and the remaining of the shortcodes.</p>
<p>Some of the drag and drop elements come with Visual Editor and respectively you can insert shortcodes.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>List of shortcodes available in the shortcode generator:</b></p>

the editor and use the drag and drop page builder to move the shortcodes
around.</p>

<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Drag and Drop Page Builder</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Drag and Drop Page Builder is based on the popular visual composer and those that know Visual Composer well may no need to read further.</p>
<p>Above the text editor in the top right side you will notice three
tabs - Visual, Text, VamTam. By default Vamtam tab - the Drag &amp; Drop
page builder will be loaded.</p>
<p>The VamTam drag &amp; drop editor is tightly integrated with tinymce
editor and you can switch to visual or text editor at any time without
losing any changes.</p>
<p>Click on or drag the element buttons to add shortcodes to the builder.</p>
<p>Once the element is inserted you will see its block into the builder.
Now you can change the width of the element, change its position
relative to the other elements( if there are more than one), delete,
clone or edit it by using the buttons that are located in the left and
right side of the shortcode block. You can insert elements into some of
the other elements - tabs,accordion, column / color box work this way.</p>
<p>You do not need to use the column/color box shortcode unless the
layout is very complex, as the width of the elements is controlled by
buttons +/- located on each element.</p>
<p>Please note that some of the element's blocks have a toggle on the right side.</p>
<p>You can open them directly in the builder and edit the text.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">Setting up a slider</span></p>
<p><br>The theme comes with <b>Layered Slider.</b> <br></p>
<p>We always
recommend importing the demo content. If you have done so you would have
imported the sample sliders that come with the theme and replicate the
one on the demo website. You can use these sliders as a starting point
for your own website. The "sample sliders" are well designed and complex
sliders. If you are not yet familiar with the slider and theme options
it is a must to use them. Layered slider is powerful and complex
parallax slider. It gives you unlimited opportunities to create slides
with many sub layers with different animation.Please note that the
Layered Slider is a plugin and have its own option panel found in the
main left side navigation menu - Layered Slider WP</p>

<p><b>Posting a ticket in the Help Desk</b></p>

the support team need to verify that you are our customer. Please provide the
Item Purchase Code if you have installed the theme on a localhost. If the theme
is installed on a Public Server you will need to enter the purchase code in the admin

<p>To
obtain the Item Purchase Code login to your ThemeForest
account that was used to purchase the theme with. Click on your
"Downloads" section and then click on "License certificate and purchase

<p><b>Contextual
Help Documentation
integrated into WordPress contextual help</b></p>
<p>This theme extends WordPress contextual help with many useful
topics. If you get stuck using the
theme, please check this source first. If the topic is not displayed in
contextual help, you may also visit this User
Manual.<br></p>
<p>To access contextual help simply hoover over the "Help" balloon bellow the titles of each
option .</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Support Channels </b></p>
<p>VamTam provides theme related support via our Help Desk,
knowledge-base &amp; video tutorials. </p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Why not a Support Forum?</b></p>
<p>Simply put, so we can offer you superior support.</p>
<p>A forum works only when you have a large enough active community -
thousands of people willing to participate on a daily basis. The smaller
the community, the more likely you are to wait for a long time before
someone answers your question. Unfortunately even the top authors in
Themeforest have only a few hundreds active users on a daily basis and
this is not enough to make the forum works</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Why not the Themeforest Comment Board?</b></p>
<p>1.The access to the Themeforest account is restricted only to the account holder and the support team cannot get involved.</p>
<p>2.It is difficult to track the communication.</p>
<p>3.You can't send sensitive information - ftp/admin credentials.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Support Hours</b></p>
<p>Our general support hours are Monday to Friday, 0 - 24h. During this
time, we can generally provide feedback on any support queries within 8 -
24 hours, whilst we will also commit to answer any queries during
weekends and holidays within 24-36 hours.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Extent of our Support </b></p>
<p>All of our items come with free support, and we have a dedicated support team to handle your requests. <b><br></b></p>
<p>We only cover support for our themes, and cannot give general
WordPress support that isn't related to our themes. For general
WordPress support you will have to use <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/support">www.WordPress.org/support</a></p>
<p>We are not able to provide support for code customizations or
third-party plugins. We understand that there is a fine line between
what is considered
support &amp; modifications. So whilst we will try to help you with any
type of query (support or modification), we cannot provide extensive
help in terms of modifications. Technical support will thus take
priority over modification support. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>Definition of Modification Support </b></p>
<p>If you are requesting modification help, which only requires us to
publish a couple lines of code, we will be glad to assist you. If
however your query requires more than that amount of code to be
published, we can only provide guidance and you would then need to hire a
developer if you don't have the skills to implement it yourself.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><b>Bug Fixing </b></p>
<p>It is our commitment to fix all theme bugs as quickly as possible
after they are brought to our attention. During our general support
hours, we can fix bugs within 24 - 48 hours.</p>
